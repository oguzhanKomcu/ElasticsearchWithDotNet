# Elasticsearch With DotNet
In this repo, I have developed a sample project on how we can use the Elasticsearch platform in a .Net project and make improvements.

## What is Elasticsearch?
 ElasticSearch is an open source, REST architecture search and analysis engine that provides users with a fast and reliable search experience. Developed by Shay Banon in 2010, ElasticSearch responds to modern data management and analysis needs.

Using a JSON-based data format and built on a powerful Apache Lucene infrastructure, this tool offers near real-time data search capacity. Users benefit from this structure in many areas such as big data applications, log management, analysis systems and content management systems.

## What is Elasticsearch used for?
Elasticsearchâ€™s speed, scalability, and ability to index many types of content enable a variety of use cases, including:

- Application search
- Website search
- Enterprise search
- Logging and log analysis
- Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Geodata analysis and visualization
- Security analytics
- Business analytics

## What are Elasticsearch Components?
Elasticsearch consists of several core components that manage the processes of storing, indexing, and searching data. These components provide the distributed structure and scalability of the system. Here are the main components of Elasticsearch:

 ### Cluster
 A cluster is the top-level structure in Elasticsearch, consisting of multiple nodes. A cluster manages all the data and indexes. Multiple nodes can run within a cluster, ensuring high availability and scalability of the data.
Each cluster has a unique name. All nodes must belong to the same cluster.

### Node
 A node is an instance of Elasticsearch (a running Elasticsearch server). A node performs operations such as storing data, indexing, and executing search queries.
A node can operate on its own or as part of a cluster. Within a cluster, nodes can take on different roles, such as a Master Node (responsible for cluster management) or a Data Node (which stores data and handles search queries).

###  Index
 An index is a collection of data. In Elasticsearch, data is stored in a specific structure called an index. For example, a website may have an index for products and another for users.
Each index contains one or more shards. Elasticsearch stores data in indices and executes queries on these indices.

### Document
A document is the smallest unit of data in Elasticsearch. It is stored in JSON format and represents a record of information. For example, each product in a product catalog is represented as a document.
Documents are stored within an index, and each document has a unique identifier (ID).

### Shard
 A shard is a physical partition of an index. Elasticsearch splits data into small parts called shards and distributes them across multiple nodes. This allows for efficient distribution and high availability of data.
Types:
 - Primary Shard: The shard that holds the original copy of the data.
 - Replica Shard: A copy of the primary shard, which increases data availability and fault tolerance.

### Mapping
 Mapping defines the structure of the data stored in an index. It specifies the types of fields in the documents, such as whether a field is a number, text, or date. Mapping is essential for defining the schema of data, ensuring accurate search and indexing. It can be set up statically or dynamically.

 ### Analyzer
 An analyzer is a component that processes text data in a document. It breaks down the text into tokens, removes stop words, and optimizes the data for searching. 
 Different analyzers can be configured for each field, allowing for customized text processing (e.g., different analyzers for "title" and "description" fields).
 
### Query DSL
 Elasticsearch queries are written using Query DSL (Domain Specific Language), a JSON-based query language. It enables complex searches, filters, and analyses to be performed. Query types include match, term, and range. Query DSL is used to fine-tune the search engine logic for better results.

### Inverted Index
Elasticsearch uses an inverted index to perform full-text searches quickly. This data structure stores words and the documents in which they appear. Inverted index significantly enhances the performance of text-based searches by reversing the relationship between words and documents.

### Snapshot and Restore
 A snapshot allows for the backup of a cluster or specific indices. The restore process retrieves data from these backups. Snapshots are used for long-term data protection and recovery.Regular snapshots ensure that a cluster can recover quickly in case of data loss.

### Elasticsearch Plugins
 Elasticsearch supports plugins that extend its functionality. Plugins can enhance the search engine, add security features, or provide additional data analysis tools.
Examples: Popular plugins include Ingest Node for data processing and X-Pack for security and monitoring.
